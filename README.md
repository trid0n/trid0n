ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Liam Winfield from Victoria, Australia. Iâ€™ve recently graduated with a graduate certificate in software development and now work full-time at a helpdesk, supporting IT systems and troubleshooting technical issues. While my primary focus is system administration, I also enjoy coding for automation and process improvement when needed.

I have experience in:

Systems administration basics (Windows, Linux, networking)
Python scripting for automation and tasks
Version control with Git and GitHub
Web technologies (HTML, CSS, basic React)
Iâ€™m passionate about improving IT systems and ensuring smooth operations, with a strong understanding of foundational networking and development principles.

Feel free to explore my projects, and reach out if you'd like to connect!
