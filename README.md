ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Liam Winfield, I am a student from victoria Australia currently studying a graduate certificate in software development
I'm just working part time at a cinema for now while I develop the necessary skills to make it in this industry. So far I have gained some
experience with: <br/>
HTML <br/>
CSS <br/>
version control through git <br/>
deployment with github pages <br/>
python <br/>
React <br/>
Bootstrap <br/>
Tailwind <br/>
and many more I am trying out as I go <br/>

I graduated with a double degree in arts/music last year and wanted to become a teacher in music/Indonesian <br/>
but eventually decided on a change of pace by pursuing a job in tech.  <br/>
Have a peruse of my projects and feel free to get in touch:  <br/>
