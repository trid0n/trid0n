- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Liam Winfield, I am a student from victoria Australia currently studying a graduate certificate in software development
I'm just working part time at a cinema for now while I develop the necessary skills to make it in this industry. So far I have gained some
experience with:
HTML
CSS
version control through git
deployment with github pages
python
React
Bootstrap
Tailwind
and many more I am trying out as I go

I graduated with a double degree in arts/music last year and wanted to become a teacher in music/Indonesian
but eventually decided on a change of pace by pursuing a job in tech. 
Have a peruse of my projects and feel free to get in touch:
