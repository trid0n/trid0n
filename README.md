- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Liam Winfield, I am a student from victoria Australia currently studying a graduate certificate in software development
I'm just working part time at a cinema for now while I develop the necessary skills to make it in this industry. So far I have gained some
experience with:
*HTML.
*CSS.
*version control through git.
*deployment with github pages.
*python and backend frameworks.

I graduated with a double degree in arts/music last year and wanted to become a teacher in music/Indonesian
but eventually decided on a change of pace by pursuing a job in tech.
